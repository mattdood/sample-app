# Sample App - Twitter-like Features

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Purpose
To explore the utilization of Rails, test driven development, and the power of various gems.

This allows for the exploration of Rails, scaffolding techniques, database migration, and TDD within the various forms and ERB templates created on the blog.

Additionally, this project is serving as a brief introduction to SASS through Bootstrap, as well as allowing for exploration of ERB syntax for stylized sheets.

This project is my first attempt at outlining static pages through partials, and will serve as a continually updating platform.

## Concept
Creation of a microblogging platform, similar to Twitter, with features that emulate the existing app.
